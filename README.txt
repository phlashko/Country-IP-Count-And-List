This will give you a list of unique IPs, organized by country they derive from, and how many unique IPs are talking to the specified destination IP.  The script will pull the data from a specified pcap file.  

1. Make sure that the pcap is in same folder as bash script.

2. Make sure that the folder the script, README, and PCAP is in, is empty; besides the aformentioned files.

3. This script will not work if results from past script are not deleted, moved, or renamed.

4. This is different than the GEO-IP as it will tell you the IPs from a country, and will give you a list of ips from those countries.

5. Enjoy, and thank you for your interest. 


        **example**    Country-IP-Count-And-List.sh pcapname.pcap 8.8.8.8
